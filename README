Before running this web app, build the sqlite3 database from the ASCII dump file.
(The database file is binary, so the ASCII file is better for version control).
This is done by typing the following (assumes sqlite3 is installed):
$ sqlite3 LivingLabDataApp.db < LivingLabDataApp.sql

Similarly, to update the dump file before committing to the git repo, type:
$ sqlite3 LivingLabDataApp.db .dump > LivingLabDataApp.sql

To run the app in development mode (on localhost), do the following:
- In app.py, change the subdomain variable (subd) near the top of the script from "/living-lab" to "" (i.e. an empty string)
- In app.py, add "debug=True" inside the parentheses in the call to app.run near the bottom of the script
- If on the FOE system, load the appropriate python modules by typing: $ module load python3 python-libs
- Run the application by typing: $ python3 LivingLabDataApp.py
- Open up a web browser and navigate to localhost:5000

Note that in order for the app to run successfully, the files AppSecretKey.txt and StravaTokens.txt must be in the app's root directory.
These files are not version-controlled as they contains sensitive data.

Don't forget to reset subd and remove from debug mode before committing to GitHub (production mode).
To make any code changes take effect on the server, ssh into it, update the git repo, and perform a restart:
$ ssh -Y cemac-ll-01
$ cd /www/living_lab/
$ git pull
$ sudo systemctl restart httpd
